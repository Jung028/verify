## 1. Definitions

We collect certain identifying personal data when you sign up for our Service, including your name, email address, PayPal address (if different from your email address), and telephone number. The personal data we collect from you is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Conclude collects Slack account and access information from Users for the purposes of connecting to the Slack API and authenticating access to information on the Conclude website. When you visit our Site, we may also collect non-identifying information such as the referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider. Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance from your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you. The term “personal data” does not include any anonymized and aggregated data created based on personal data, which is wholly owned by Conclude.

## 2. General Terms

### Service Provided "AS IS"

The Service is provided for free during this pilot project and is provided "as is" with no warranty. Conclude will provide User support for the Service; however, Conclude is not committed to any level of service or availability of the Service. A further description of the Service and our user support is available on the Site.

### Interoperation with Slack

The Service interoperates with Slack.com and depends on the continuing availability and access to Slack. If, for any reason, Conclude cannot access or use Slack (including, without limitation, changes in terms or an increase in fees charged by Slack), Conclude may not be able to provide all the functions of its Service. No refund or credit, if applicable, will be provided for temporary unavailability of Slack (e.g., during maintenance windows).

If you enter into this agreement on behalf of a company, you hereby agree that the company is responsible under this Agreement for all actions and omissions conducted by its designated users of the Service.

## 4. Intellectual Property Rights

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you choose to provide information to us, Conclude transfers Personal Information to Google Cloud Platform and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, followed by your submission of such information, represents your agreement to that transfer.
